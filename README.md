This project interacts with a React app to find a fake bar out of 9 gold bars. The React app allows you to compare a set of bars against another set of bars to see if one weighs more than the other. It also will tell you if they are equal. With the current implementation, the algorithm will always be able to figure out the fake bar in 2 weighings.

To make sure you have the right libraries in python, you can go to the terminal and run `pip install selenium`.

If you are still having trouble refer to https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/getting_started/install_library/.
